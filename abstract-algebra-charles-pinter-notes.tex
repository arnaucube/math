% 
% $\mathbb{R} \supseteq \mathbb{Q} \supseteq \mathbb{Z} \supseteq \mathbb{N}$
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item $\mathbb{R}$ (reals): $\{ \ldots, -3, 0, \sqrt{2}, 2, e, \pi, 4, \ldots \}$
%     \item $\mathbb{Q}$ (rationals): $\{ \frac{a}{b} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \wedge b \neq 0 \}$
%     \item $\mathbb{Z}$ (integers): $\{ \ldots, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, \ldots \}$
%     \item $\mathbb{N}$ (naturals): non negative integers, $\{1, 2, 3, ...\}$
% \end{itemize}

\section{Groups}

\begin{definition}[Group]
    A set $G$ with an operation $*$ which satisfies the axioms:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item $*$ is \emph{associative}
	\item \emph{(identity element)} there is an element $e \in G$ s.t. $a * e = a$ and $e * a = a$ $\forall a \in G$
	\item \emph{(inverse)} $\forall a \in G$, there is an element $a^{-1} \in G$ s.t. $a*a^{-1} = e$ and $a^{-1} * a =e$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Abelian Group]
    A group $G$ is said to be \emph{commutative} if $\forall a, b \in G$, $ab = ba$. A commutative group is also called \emph{Abelian}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Order of an element]
    In a group $G$, the order of an element $a \in G$ is the least positive integer $n$ such that $a \cdot a \cdots a = a^n = e$. It is represented by $ord(a)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Order of a group]
    Order of a group $G$, is the number of elements in $G$. It is represented by $|G|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cyclic group]
    Let $G$ be a group, and $a \in G$. If $G$ consists of all the powers of $a$ and nothing else:
    $$G = \{a^n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$
    then, $G$ is called a \emph{cyclic group}, and $a$ is called its \emph{generator}.
    \\
    The group $G$ generated by $a$ is defined by $G=\langle a \rangle$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    The \emph{order of a cyclic group} is the same as the \emph{order of it's generator}. In other words, for a cyclic group, $|\langle a \rangle | = ord(a)$.
    \begin{itemize}
	\item[] $\langle a \rangle$ defines a cyclic group generated by $a$. $\langle a \rangle = \{e, a, a^2, ..., a^{n-1}\}$
	\item[] $| \langle a \rangle |$ defines the order of the cyclic group generated by $a$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
\end{theorem}



\section{Subgroups}
\begin{definition}[Subgroup]
    Let $G$ be a group, and $H$ a non-empty subset of $G$. If
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item the idenity $e$ of $G$ is in $H$.
	\item $H$ is closed with respect to the operation. Which is for $a, b \in H$, $ab \in H$.
	\item $H$ is closed with respect to inverses. Which is for $a \in H$, $a^{-1} \in H$.
    \end{enumerate}
    we call $H$ a \emph{subgroup} of $G$. The operation of $H$ is the same as the operation of $G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
\end{theorem}

\section{Functions}
\begin{definition}[Function]
    If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then a function from $A$ to $B$ is a rule which to every element $x$ in $A$ assigns a unique element $y$ in $B$.
    \\
    Functions are represented by $f: A \rightarrow B$, where $\forall a \in A \Rightarrow f(a) \in B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Injective (monomorphism)]
    A function $f:A \rightarrow B$ is called \emph{injective} if each element of $B$ is the image of no more than one element of $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Surjective (epimorphism)]
    A function $f:A \rightarrow B$ is called \emph{surjective} if each element of $B$ is the image of at least one element of $A$.
    \\ In other words, does not repeat outputs.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Bijective (isomorphism)]
    A function $f:A \rightarrow B$ is called \emph{bijective} if it is both \emph{injective} and \emph{surjective}.
    \\
    A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ has an inverse iff it is \emph{bijective}. In that case, the inverse $f^{-1}$ is a bijective function from $B$ to $A$.
\end{definition}

In finite sets, if $f: A \rightarrow B$ is injective then $|A| \leq |B|$, and if $f$ is surjective then $|B| \leq |A|$. And if $f$ is bijective, then $|A| = |B|$.

\begin{definition}[Composite function]
    A function $f:A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$ be functions. The \emph{composite function} denoted by $g \circ f$ is a function from $A$ to $C$ defined as follows:
    $$[g \circ f](x) = g(f(x)),  \forall x \in A$$
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Permutation]
    By a \emph{permutation} of a set $A$ we mean a \emph{bijective function from $A$ to $A$}, that is, a one-to-one correspondence between $A$ and itself.
    \\
    The set of all the permutations of $A$, with the operation $\circ$ of composition, is a group.
    \\
    For any positive integer $n$, the symmetric group on the set ${1,2, 3,..., n}$ is called the \emph{symmetric group on $n$ elements}, and is denoted by $S_n$.
\end{definition}

% TODO define 'group of permutations' & 'cycle of permutations'

\section{Isomorphism}

\begin{definition}[Isomorphism]
    Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups. A bijective function $f: G_1 \rightarrow G_2$ with the property that for any two elements $a, b \in G_1$,
    $$f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$$
    is called an \emph{isomorphism} from $G_1$ to $G_2$.
    \\
    If there exists an isomorphism from $G_1$ to $G_2$, we say that $G_1$ is \emph{isomorphic} to $G_2$, symbolized by $G_1 \cong G_2$.
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}[Cayley's Theorem]
    Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    (Isomorphism of cyclic groups)
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item For every positive integer $n$, every cyclic group of order $n$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Thus, any two cyclic groups of order $n$ are isomorphic to each other.
	\item Every cyclic group of order infinity is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, and therefore any two cyclic groups of order infinity are isomorphic to each other.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\section{Cosets}

\begin{definition}[Coset]
    Let $G$ be a group, and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. For any element $a$ in $G$, the symbol $aH$ denotes the set of all products $ah$, as $a$ remains fixed and $h$ ranges over $H$. $aH$ is caled a \emph{left coset} of $H$ in $G$.
    \\
    In similar fashion, $Ha$ denotes the set of all products $ha$, as $a$ remains fixed an $h$ ranges over $H$. $Ha$ is called a \emph{right coset} of $H$ in $G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    If $Ha$ is any coset of $H$, there is a one-to-one correspondence from $H$ to $Ha$ (there is a bijection between $H$ and $Ha$).\\
    If $a \in G$, then $|H| = |Ha|$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Lagrange's theorem]
    Let $G$ be a finite group, and $H$ any subgroup of $G$. The order of $G$ is a multiple of the order of $H$. $|H|$ divides $|G|$.
\end{theorem}
    Lagrange's theorem can be easily seen by the facts that:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item cosets partition the group G
	\item $|Ha| = |H|$ (each coset has the same order as H). 
    \end{enumerate}

By consequence,
\begin{theorem}
    If $G$ is a group with a prime number $p$ of elements, then $G$ is a cyclic group. Furthermore, any element $a \neq e$ in $G$ is a generator of $G$.
\end{theorem}

Thus,
\begin{theorem}
    The order of any element of a finite group divides the order of the group.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Index of H in G]
    Number of cosets of H in G. Represented by $(G:H)$.\\
    Combined with \emph{Lagrange Theorem}, we know that $|G| = |H| \cdot |G:H|$, so,
    $$(G:H) = \frac{|G|}{|H|}$$
\end{definition}


\section{Homomorphisms}

\begin{definition}[Homomorhism]
    If $G$ and $G$ are groups, a \emph{homomorphism} from $G$ to $H$ is a function $f: G \rightarrow H$ s.t. for any two elements $a, b \in G$,
    $$f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$$
    If there exists a homomorphism from $G$ \emph{onto} $H$, we say that $H$ is a \emph{homomorphic image} of $G$.
\end{definition}
Note: an \emph{isomorphism} is a \emph{bijective} \emph{homomorphism}.
\\
Example of an \emph{homomorphism}: $f: \mathbb{Z}_6 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_3$.


\begin{theorem}
    Let $G$ and $G$ be groups, and $f: G \rightarrow H$ a homomorphism. Then
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item $f(e) = e$
	\item $f(a^{-1}) = [f(a)]^{-1}, \quad \forall a \in G$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Conjugate]
    A \emph{conjugate} of $a$ is any element of the form $xax^{-1}$, where $x \in G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Normal subgroup]
    Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. $H$ is called a \emph{normal} subgroup of $G$ if it is closed with respect to conjugates, that is, if\\
    for any $a \in H$ and $x \in G$, $xax^{-1} \in H$.
    \\
    Alternatively, we can see that $H$ is a \emph{normal} subgroup iff $\forall a \in G, aH = Ha$.
    \\
    In an abelian group, every subgroup is normal.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Kernel]\label{def:homomorphismkernel}
    Let $f: G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism. The \emph{kernel} of $f$ is the set $K$ of all the elements of $G$ which are carried by $f$ onto the neutral element of $H$. That is,
    $$K = {x \in G : f(x) = e}$$
    \emph{Kernel in the context of Extension fields: \ref{def:extensionkernel}}
\end{definition}
For every homomorphism, the $e \in G$ maps to $e \in H$, so the \emph{kernel} is never empty, it always contains the identity $e_G$, and if the kernel only contains the identity, then $f$ is one-to-one (injective).


\section{Quotient Groups}

Quotient group construction is useful as a way of actually manufacturing all the homomorphic images of any group G. Additionally, we can often choose $H$ so as to "factor out" unwanted properties of $G$, and prserve in $G/H$ only "desirable" traits.

\begin{definition}[Coset multiplication]
    The coset of $a$, multiplied by the coset of $b$, is defined to be the coset of $ab$. In symbols, $Ha \cdot Hb = H(ab)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. If $Ha = Hc$ and $Hb = Hd$, then $H(ab) = H(cd)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
    $G/H$ denotes the set which consists of \emph{all the cosets of $H$}.
    \\
    Thus, if $Ha, Hb, Hc, \ldots$ are cosets of $H$, then $G/H = \{ Ha, Hb, Hc, ... \}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Quotient group]
    $G/H$ with coset multiplication is a group.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    $G/H$ is a homomorphic image of G.
    \\
    Conversely, every homomorphic image of $G$ is a quotient group of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. Then
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item $Ha = Hb$ iff ${ab}^{-1} \in H$
	\item $Ha = H$ iff $a \in H$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}


\section{Rings and Fields}

\begin{definition}[Ring]
    A set $A$ with operations called \emph{addition} and \emph{multiplication} which satisfy the following axioms:
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item $A$ with addition alone is an abelian group.
	\item Multiplication is associative.
	\item Multiplication is distributive over addition. That is, $\forall a,b,c \in A$,
	    $$a(b+c) = ab + ac$$
	    $$(b+c)a = ba + ca$$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Commutative ring]
    By definition, addition is commutative in every ring but multiplication is not. When multiplication also is commutative in a ring, we call that ring a \emph{commutative} ring.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Unity]
    A ring does not necessarily have a neutral element for multiplication. If there is in $A$ a neutral element for mulitplication, it is called the \emph{unity} of $A$, and is denoted by the symbol $1$.
    \\
    If $A$ has a unity, we call $A$ a \emph{ring with unity}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Field]
    If $A$ is a commutative ring with unity in which every nonzero element is invertible, $A$ is called a \emph{field}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Finite Field must be over p prime ($\mathbb{F}_p$)]
    Proof from \href{https://github.com/aragonzkresearch/blog/blob/main/pdf/Aragon_Math_Seminar.pdf}{Matan Prasma seminars}:\\
    One of the axioms of a field is $\exists$ multiplicative inverse.\\
    If $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with $n$ no prime, then $n= k \cdot l$ for some $1 \leq k,~l \leq n-1$.\\
    Then in $\mathbb{Z}_n$, $k \cdot l = 0$, but if $k \cdot l=0$ means that either $k=0$ or $l=0$ (otherwise, we could multiply by (eg) $k^{-1}$ and get $k^{-1} \cdot k \cdot l = k^{-1} \cdot 0$, which leads to $1 \cdot l = 0$).\\
    which is a contradiction here (since $1 \leq k,~l \leq n-1$).\\
    Thus $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with $n$ not prime can not be a field.\\
    Conversely, if $n = p$ prime,\\
    for $0 \neq x \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, $gcd(x, p)=1$, so Extended Euclidean Algorithm gives $u, v \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $u x + v p = 1$.\\
    Then, $ux=1 \pmod p$, so $u=x^{-1}$, so inverses exist.\\
    Thus $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Divisor of zero]
    In any ring, a nonzero element a is called a \emph{divisor of zero} if there is a
    nonzero element b in the ring such that the product ab or ba is equal to
    zero.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cancellation property]
A ring is said to have the cancellation property if $ab = ac$ or $ba = ca$ implies $b = c$
for any elements a, b, and c in the ring if $a \neq 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    A ring has the \emph{cancellation property} iff it has no \emph{divisors of zero}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Ideal]
    A nonempty subset $B$ of a ring $A$ is called an \emph{ideal} of $A$ if $B$ is closed with respect to addition and negatives, and $B$ absorbs products in $A$.
    \\
    (\emph{Absorbs product}: $\forall b \in B$ and $x \in A$, then $xb, bx \in B$).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Principal ideal]
    A \emph{principal ideal} is an ideal $I$ in a ring $R$ that is generated by a single element $a \in R$ through multiplication by every element of $R$. In other words $I = aR = \{a r : r \in R \}$.
    \\
    (eg. Every ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$ is principal).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Integral domain]
    An \emph{integral domain} is defined to be a commutative ring with unity having the cancellation property.
\end{definition}

Every field is an integral domain, but the converse is not true (eg. $\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain but not a field).

\begin{definition}[Characteristic n]
    Let $A$ be a ring with unity, the \emph{characteristic} of $A$ is the least positive integer $n$ such that
    $$\underbrace{1 + 1 + \cdots + 1}_{n-times} = 0$$
    If there is no such positive integer $n$, $A$ has characteristic $0$.
\end{definition}

\section{Elements of number theory}

\begin{definition}[Euclid's lemma]
    Let $m$ and $n$ be integers, and let $p$ be a prime. If $p|(mn)$, then either $p|m$ or $p|n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Factorization into primes]
    Ever integer $n>1$ can be expressed as a product of positive primes. That is, there are one or more primes $p_1, \ldots, p_r$ such that $n=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Unique factorization]
    Suppose $n$ can be factored into positive primes in two ways, namely,
    $$n= p_1 \cdots p_r = q_1 \cdots q_t$$
    Then $r=t$, and the $p_i$ are the same numbers as the $q_j$ except, possibly, for the order in which they appear.
\end{theorem}

From the last two theorems: every integer $m$ can be factored into primes, and the prime factors of $m$ are unique (except for the order).

\begin{theorem}[Little theorem of Fermat]
    Let $p$ be a prime. Then,
    $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p, \forall a \not\equiv 0 \pmod p$$
    \\
    So, by taking $a^{p-2} \cdot a \equiv 1 \pmod p$, where $a^{p-2} \equiv a^{-1} \pmod p$ (the inverse modulo p), we see that $a^p \equiv a \pmod p, \forall a \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $a^p - a$ is a multiple of $p$.

    ~\\\emph{Relation to Lagrange's theorem:}\\
    Let $G = \mathbb{Z}_p$, and let $H$ be the multiplicative subgroup of $G$ generated by $a$ (ie. $H = \{ 1, a, a^2, \ldots \}$). The order of $H$ ($h = |H|$), is also the order of $a$ (ie. smallest $n>1$ s.t. $a^n=1~mod~p$).

    By Lagrange's theorem, $h~|~|G| = p - 1$, so $p-1 = h \cdot m$, thus
    $$
    a^{p-1} = (a^h)^m \equiv 1^m \equiv 1~mod~p
    $$

    ~\\\emph{Another perspective:}\\
    We have $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$, by dividing by $a$ on both sides, we obtain $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Euler's $\phi$ function]
    \emph{Euler's $\phi$ function} describes the number of integers in $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ which are relatively prime (coprime) to $n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Euler's theorem]
    If $a$ and $n$ are relatively prime, $$a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n$$
\end{theorem}


\section{Polynomials}

\begin{definition}
    Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity, and $x$ an arbitrary symbol. Every expression of the form
    $$a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n$$
    is called a \emph{polynomial in $x$ with coefficients in $A$}, or more simply, a \emph{polynomial in $x$ over $A$}.
\end{definition}
 The expressions $a_k x^k$, for $k \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$, are called the \emph{terms} of the polynomial, being $a_n x^n$ the \emph{leading term}, and $a_0$ the \emph{constant term}.
 The $a_k$ are called the \emph{coefficients} of $x^k$, being $a_n$ the \emph{leading coefficient}. And the \emph{degree} of a polynomial $a(x)$ is the greatest $n$ such that the coefficient of $x^n$ is not zero.
 The polynomial whose leading coefficient is equal to $1$ is called \emph{monic}.

\begin{theorem}[Division algorithm for polynomials]
    If $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are polynomials over a field $F$, and $b(x) \neq 0$, there exist polynomials $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ over $F$ such that
    $a(x) = b(x) q(x) + r(x)$ and
    [$r(x) = 0$ or $\deg r(x) < \deg b(x)$].
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Any two nonzero polynomials $a(x), b(x) \in F[x]$ have a $\gcd d(x)$. Furthermore, $d(x)$ can be expressed as a \emph{linear combination}
    $$d(x)= r(x) a(x) + s(x) b(x)$$
    where $r(x), s(x) \in F[x]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Factorization into irreducible polynomials]
    Every polynomial $a(x)$ of positive degree in $F[x]$ can be written as a product
    $$a(x) = k p_1(x) p_2(x) \cdots p_r(x)$$
    where $k$ is a constant in $F$ and $p_1(x), \ldots, p_r(x)$ are monic irreducible polynomials of $F[x]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Unique factorization]
    If $a(x)$ can be written in two ways as a product of monic irreducibles, say
    $$a(x) = k p_1(x) \cdots p_r(x) = l q_1(x) \cdots q_s(x)$$
    then $k=l$, $r=s$, and $p_i(x) = q_j(x)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    $c$ is a root of $a(x)$ iff $x - c$ is a factor of $a(x)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
    If $a(x)$ has distinct roots $c_1, \ldots, c_m$ in $F$, then $(x-c_1)(x-c_2)\cdots(x-c_m)$ is a factor of $a(x)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    If $a(x)$ has degree $n$, it has at most $n$ roots.
\end{theorem}

In finite $F$, polynomial $\neq$ polynomial function. If $F$ is infinite, polynomial $=$ polynomial function.

For every polynomial with rational coefficients, there is a polynomial with integer coefficients having the same roots. See:
$$a(x) = \frac{k_0}{l_0} + \frac{k_1}{l_1} x + \cdots + \frac{k_n}{l_n} x^n$$
$$=\frac{1}{l_0 \cdots l_n} \cdot \underbrace{(k_0 l_1 \cdots l_n + k_1 l_0 l_2 \cdots l_n x + \cdots + k_n l_0 \cdots l_{n-1} x^n)}_{b(x)}$$
$a(x)$ has rational coefficients, $b(x)$ has integer coefficients. $b(x)$ differs from $a(x)$ only by a constant factor ($\frac{1}{l_0\cdots l_n}$), so $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ have the same roots.

$\Longrightarrow~~\forall~p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, there is a $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}$ with the same roots (for every polynomial with rational coefficients, there is a polynomial with integer coefficients having the same roots).

\begin{theorem}
    If $s/t$ is a root of $a(x)$, then $s|a_0$ and $t|a_n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Suppose $a(x)$ can be factored as $a(x) = b(x)c(x)$, where $b(x), c(x)$ have rational coefficients. Then there are polynomials $B(x), C(x)$ with integer coefficients, which are constant multiples of $b(x)$ and $c(x)$ respectively, such that $a(x) = B(x)C(x)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion]
    Let $a(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients.

    If there is a prime $p$ such that $p | a_i, ~\forall i\in\{0, n-1\}$, and $p \ndiv a_n$ and $p^2 \ndiv a_0$, then $a(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.
    % Suppose there is a prime number $p$ which divides every coefficient of $a(x)$ except the leading coefficient $a_n$; suppose $p$ does not divide $a_n$ and $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$. Then $a(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Extensions of fields}

\begin{definition}[Kernel]\label{def:extensionkernel}
    The \emph{kernel} of $\sigma_c$ consists of all polynomials $a(x) \in F[x]$ such that $c$ is a root of $a(x)$.

    \emph{Kernel in the context of Homomorphisms: \ref{def:homomorphismkernel}}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Algebraic]
    $c \in E$ is called \emph{algebraic over} $F$ if it is the root of some nonzero polynomial $a(x) \in F[x]$.

    Otherwise, $c$ is called \emph{transcendental over} $F$.
\end{definition}

$E/K$ denotes the (field) extension of $E$ over $K$.

\begin{theorem}[Basic theorem of field extensions]
    Let $F$ be a field and $a(x) \in F[x]$ a nonconstant polynomial. There exists an extension field $E/F$ and an element $c \in E$ such that $c$ is a root of $a(x)$.
\end{theorem}

Let $a(x) \in F[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. There is an extension field $E/F$ which contains all $n$ roots of $a(x)$.

\section{Vector spaces}

\begin{definition}[Vector space]
    A \emph{vector space} over a field $F$ is a set $V$, with two operations $+, \cdot$, called \emph{vector addition} and \emph{scalar multiplication}, such that

    \begin{itemize}
	\item $V$ with vector addition is an abelian group
	\item $\forall k \in F$ and $\overrightarrow{a} \in V$, the scalar product $k \overrightarrow{a}$ is an element of $V$, subject to the following conditions:
	    $\forall k, l \in F,~\overrightarrow{a},\overrightarrow{b} \in V$
	    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
		\item $k(\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b}) = k\overrightarrow{a} + k\overrightarrow{b}$
		\item $(k + l)\overrightarrow{a} = k\overrightarrow{a} + k\overrightarrow{b}$
		\item $k(l\overrightarrow{a}) = (kl)\overrightarrow{a}$
		\item $1 \overrightarrow{a} = \overrightarrow{a}$
	    \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Linear combination]
    If $\overrightarrow{a_1}, \overrightarrow{a_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{a_n} \in V$, and $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n$ are scalars, then the vector
    $$k_1 \overrightarrow{a_1} + k_2 \overrightarrow{a_2} + \cdots + k_n \overrightarrow{a_n}$$
    is called a \emph{linear combination} of $\overrightarrow{a_1}, \overrightarrow{a_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{a_n}$.

    The set of all the linear combinations of $\overrightarrow{a_1}, \overrightarrow{a_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{a_n}$ is a \emph{subspace of} $V$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Linear dependancy]
    Let $S = \{$\overrightarrow{a_1}, \overrightarrow{a_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{a_n}$\}$ be a set of distinct vectors in a vector space $V$. $S$ is said to be \emph{linearly dependent} if there are scalars $k_1, \ldots, k_n$, not all zero, such that $k_1 \overrightarrow{a_1} + k_2 \overrightarrow{a_2} + \cdots + k_n \overrightarrow{a_n} = 0$.
    Which is equivalent to saying that at least one of the vectors in $S$ is a linear combination of the others.

    If $S$ is not linearly dependent, then it is \emph{linearly independent}. $S$ is linearly independent iff $k_1 \overrightarrow{a_1} + k_2 \overrightarrow{a_2} + \cdots + k_n \overrightarrow{a_n}=0$ implies $k_1 = k_2 = \cdots =  k_n =0$.
    Which is equivalent to saying thatno vector in $S$ is equal to a linear combination of the other vectors in $S$.
\end{definition}

If $\{ \overrightarrow{a_1}, \overrightarrow{a_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{a_n} \}$ is linearly dependent, then some $a_i$ is a linear combination of the preceding ones.

If $\{ \overrightarrow{a_1}, \overrightarrow{a_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{a_n} \}$ spans $V$, and $a_i$ is a linear combination of the preceding vectors, then $\{ \overrightarrow{a_1}, \ldots, \crossover{\overrightarrow{a_i}}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{a_n} \}$ still spans $V$.


\begin{theorem}
    Any two bases of a vector space $V$ have the same number of elements.

    (This comes from the fact that all bases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ contain exactly $n$ vectors)
\end{theorem}

If the  set $(\overrightarrow{a_1}, \overrightarrow{a_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{a_n})$ spans $V$, it contains a basis of $V$.
